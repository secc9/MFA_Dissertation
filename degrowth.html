  <h1>degrowth.</h1>

  <p>
degrowth is a term by french theorist [[id:134ED327-DCAB-4EB0-945E-A086EEF10FFC][Serge Latouch]].
  </p>

  <p>
"We must abandon the goal of exponential growth, as that goal is promoted by nothing other than a quest for profits on the part of the owners of capital and has distatrous implications for the envoronmentm and therefore for humanity"[1] pg8
  </p>

  <p>
It's been just over fifteen years since Latouche wrote the above sentence. One could say that the world is currently run by corporations, who lobby polititans to overturn laws that go in favour of themselves and profit for them and their shareholders. The UK is up there with the best of them when it comes to this.  There has been a slow but steady selling off of the National Health Service.[2][3] The Royal Mail has been sold to a Czech billionaire[3]. Donald Trump has just become the President of the United States for the second time, and was surrounded by tech billionaires as he was inagurated[4]. As a society, we are seeminlgly happy for continuous growth to carry on happening, as we continously told by the leaders of our governments that this is key. This is what keeps us in employment. This is what keeps the world turning. As long as we can carry on purchasing new clothes each weekend when the paycheck comes in and go out drinking to forget about the horrors which we endured throught the week which has just passed then I guess all is fine. Thereappears to be some irony in all of this though. Aws we are now more connected  with the world through social media, it is easier to share with others the things you are going through with others. We are now seeing social media videos of factory worker conditions at fast fashion companies as well as reports where workers are working upwards of 75 hours per week [6]. The brand Burberry admitted to demolishing stock in an effort to protect the brand [7].
Let us not forget the Atacama Desert in Chile which has become the "great fashion garbage patch"[8]. the fast fashion industry is quite an easy target as there is much written about it as it employs many people. It could even be spun that the aformentioned Atacama dump is providing employment for the poople living at its edge. The same is true for the technology industry. We live for an ever growing lust for speed, computing power and larger storage. We want our games and applications to run faster, look better and have more features.  Latouche suggests that the quest for growth here is merely a quest for profit. That the owners of capital are willing to 'destroy' humanity for their short term profit. We see this everywhere, even more today. Unfortunatly for the majority of the humans on the planet "are cogs in that machine, and we may collude with it, but we are definitely not the driving force behind it." [9]-pg3. Unfortunatly the majority of us cannot escape being cogs in this machine. By not having the luck to be born into some kind of familial generational wealth situation or even having the genetic makeup for the drive to "make-money" we are stuck with our lot. This also doubles down on us as we are unknowingly opressed. [[id:0BFBDB1D-1D24-4C66-A0A8-FEFE24389AAA][PauloFreire]] writes more about this in his 'manual' [[id:E3063CA4-4126-4838-82AF-6D053221A1AC][PedagogyOfTheOppressed]]. Due to this trickle down, growth led ideology of late-stage capitalism, we, the proletariat, are trapped with no way out. To Conservative Party of the UK are renouned for the slogan "Pull yourself up by your bootstraps". This is a paradoxical act as phisics demands that it is impossible for this actual action to happen. What happens if you don't even own a pair of boots, never mind a pair with bootstraps.

  <p>
This is seemingly entwined with [[id:9AF5CEE6-5F63-4EDB-A14E-F5D582C812E6][PlannedObsolescence]]. The idea that commodities are poorly made so that consumers have to replace instead of repair, therefore adding to waste as well as profits.
