  <h1>Open Source Software</h1>



  <p>
    I found my way into the world of open source software after my long, self enforced rest from attempting to work in the music industry. I first came to music software in the late nineties when I was invited to a work collegues flat to see his setup. At the time, I was attempting to play bass guitar in a band and had previously attended a short music course provided by York College which,  over a few weeks, introduced the cohort to things like samplers, grooveboxes, computer sequencers among other things. Not knowing what to expect, I entered my collegues bedsit and found a large table with a computer and a few other bits of audio machinery on it. This was my first experience with a computer since rudimentry information technology classes with BBC Acorn computers<sup><a href="#fn1" id "ref1">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    My collegue switched on these machines in some order and booted up the big, beige computer tower and then the computer monitor flickered into life. After pressing a bunch of  switches on machines and loading up some program on the computer, he hit the spacebar and music came tumbling out from the speakers. He showed me how the software worked and we messed around for a while making something that could loosely be classed as music.
    Some months had passed and I had, by paying by monthly installments, finally aquired my own computer. I spoke to my collegue and he handed me over some compact discs with something called 'cracked software' on it. This was around the year 1998. For the longest time I did this cracked software route. Using P2P<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> software in an attempt to get hold of the latest passwords or software for me to use on my machine in the attempt to make music. I'm I'm honest about it, it was more about the consumption of products than it was about making music (this is still the case almost thirty years later). Even whilst putting myself though a music production course as well as working in a recording studio I was doing this. It was a good few years until I could afford to start purchasing software. A copy of Logic Pro Audio was around the £500 mark at the time.

    At a certain point, I began to search for a way to make my own audio plugins so I could create music without the act of being <a href="oppression.html">forced into purchasing more tools that make me sound like everyone else</a>. In lists of "best free software packages" in the usual music production magazines, I read about this program called SuperCollider<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>,  but the cons always mentioned about the steep learning curve so I always shied away from it. I had bought a couple of records at the time by the artist Cylob and I was impressed how his use of sounds sounded like nothing else I had heard. After doing some research i found that he had build his own music software using Supercollider. The Cylob Music System 3000. He himself also said that "although it had a much steeper learning curve, was much more flexible in terms of sound patching and generation." <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>

    I downloaded it, opened the software, and was greeted with a small, blank, white window and a couple of little (server) windows. and not much else. I think I recall closing it straight away and not opening it again for maybe another year. I slowly made progress with the tool. Working, getting stuck and quitting tutorials over and over became the norm. Looking through the SuperCollider mailing lists for tips, but having no real idea what was happening. This was my first entry into programming and working with a programming language. The only time I had programmed before was typing in a line of code to boot up a game from a floppy disc from the aformentioned Acorns at high school in the early 90's. This was also my first exposure to open source software and the community that surrounded it. Users were freely sharing code and programs built on the platform. I spent lots of time doing this. Using other peoples programs, with the idea that I could maybe hack into their code, or at the very least, see their code and see how something was built.
    , text based, audio composition tool. It is notoriously known for having a steep learning curve, requiring many hours of patent practice to be able to use it. I found this out the hard way.

  I have found this out. I have been using the software on and off for the last 18 or so years, sometimes with huge breaks, as I found it difficult to learn. Resources were scarce, Some of the people running workshops were the academic, programmer bro type.
