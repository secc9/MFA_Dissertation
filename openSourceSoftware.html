  <h1>open Source Software</h1>



  <p>
    I found my way into the world of open source software after my long, self enforced rest from attempting to work in the music industry. I first came to music software in the late nineties when I was invited to a work collegues flat to see his setup. At the time, I was attempting to play bass guitar in a band and had previously attended a short music course provided by York Collage which,  over a few weeks, introduced the cohort to things like samplers, grooveboxes, computer sequencers among other things. Not knowing what to expect, I entered my collegues bedsit and found a large table with a computer and a few other bits of audio machinery on it. This was my first experience with a computer since rudimentry information technology classes with BBC Acorn computers[1]

    - the SuperCollider[2] software is an open source, text based, audio composition tool. It is notoriously known for having a steep learning curve, requiring many hours of patent practice to be able to use it. I found this out the hard way.

  I began using this software in around 2007, after searching and searching for a way to make my own audio plugins so I could create music withought the act of being forced into purchasing more tools that make me sound like <a href="oppression.html">everyone else</a>. I had seen it in lists of "best free software packages" in the usual music production magazines but the cons always mentioned about the steep learning curve so I always shied away from it. I had bought a couple of records at the time by the artist [[id:F340728F-DEBA-499A-BF48-7E50E6036E7F][Cylob]] and I was impressed how his use of sounds sounded like nothing else I had heard. I did some reasearch and found that he had build his own music software using [[id:59782222-C03B-4ED1-9DF0-51733AF3C989][supercollider]]. The Cylob Music System 3000. He himself also said that "although it had a much steeper learning curve, was much more flexible in terms of sound patching and generation."[3]

  I downloaded it, opened the software, and was greeted with a small, blank, white window and a couple of little (server) windows. and not much else. I think I recal closing it straight away and not opening it again for maybe another year.

  I have found this out. I have been using the software on and off for the last 18 or so years, sometimes with huge breaks, as I found it difficult to learn. Resources were scarce, Some of the people running workshops were the academic, programmer bro type.
