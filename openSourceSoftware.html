  <h1>Open Source Software</h1>



  <p>
   
I found my way into the world of open-source software after a long, self-enforced rest from attempting to work in the music industry. I first came to music software in the late nineties when I was invited to a colleague's flat to see his music setup. I was attempting to play bass guitar in a band at the time. I had previously attended a short music course provided by York College, which,  over a few weeks, introduced the cohort to things like samplers, groove boxes, and computer sequencers, among other things. Not knowing what to expect, I entered my colleague's bedside and found a large table with a computer and a few other bits of audio machinery on it. This was my first experience with a computer since rudimentary information technology classes with BBC Acorn computers I found my way into the world of open source software after my long, self enforced rest from attempting to work in the music industry.

   My colleague switched on these machines in some order and booted up the big, beige computer tower, and then the computer monitor flickered into life. After pressing several switches on the machines and loading up some programs on the computer, he hit the spacebar, and music came tumbling out from the speakers. He showed me how the software worked, and we played around for a while, making something that could be loosely classed as music. Some months passed, and I finally acquired my own computer by paying in monthly instalments. I spoke to my colleague, and he handed over some compact discs with 'cracked software' on them. This was around the year 1998.  For the longest time, I have been doing this cracked software route, using P2P<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> software in an attempt to get hold of the latest passwords or software for me to use on my machine in the attempt to make music. If I am to be brutally honest about it, it was more about the consumption of products than it was about making music (this is still the case almost thirty years later). Even while putting myself through a music production course and working in a recording studio, I was doing this. It was a good few years until I could afford to purchase software. A copy of Logic Pro Audio (an industry standard digital audio workstation) was around the £500 mark back then.

   At a certain point, I began to search for a way to make my own audio plugins to create music without being<a href="oppression.html">forced into purchasing more tools that make me sound like everyone else</a>. In lists of "best free software packages" in the usual music production magazines, I read about a program called SuperCollider<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, but the cons always mentioned the steep learning curve, so I always shied away from it. At the time, I had bought a couple of records by the artist Cylob, and I was impressed how his use of sounds sounded like nothing else I had heard. After researching, I found that he had built his music software using Supercollider. The Cylob Music System 3000. He also said that "although it had a much steeper learning curve, was much more flexible in terms of sound patching and generation."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>

  I downloaded it, opened the software, and was greeted with a small, blank, white window, a few extra windows, and nothing else. I recall closing it immediately and not opening it again for another year. Over the next few years, I slowly made progress with the tool. Working, getting stuck and quitting tutorials over and over became the norm. I was looking through the SuperCollider mailing lists for tips but had no real idea what was happening. This was my first entry into programming and working with a programming language, and I was working alone. At this time, I did not know anyone who was a programmer. No one in my circle programmed, so I had no reference on what it was to program, how hard it would be or any support structure or advice. I did not want to post questions to the mailing lists as answers that came back appeared to be even more complicated than the questions posed. Even though the lists were friendly, they felt like a place of a real assumption of knowledge, and this assumption only left me feeling even more left out. The only time I had programmed before was typing in a line of code to boot up a game from a floppy disc from the aforementioned Acorns at high school in the early '90s. This was also my first exposure to open-source software and its surrounding community. Users were freely sharing code and programs built on the platform. I spent lots of time doing this and using other people's programs, with the idea that I could hack into their code or, at the very least, see their code and see how something was built. </p>

   Paulo Friere writes <a href="oppression.html"> "Freedom is aquired by contest, not by gift"</a><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.
I have been finding this over the last 17 or so years. I have been using the software intermittently for the last 18 years, sometimes with massive breaks, as I found learning challenging. In the early days of this software,  resources were scarce; some people running workshops were the academic, programmer-bro type. Giving short or seemingly cryptic answers to things that seemed blindingly obvious to them, with training and years of experience, but to a complete novice, something that could induce migraines. Knowledge, for the working classes, is something that is fought for, not given. As a youth, how can it be whilst living a chaotic home life, working before or after school, hungry, and having no help with homework whilst at home? Even as an adult, with the chance to return to education, things can become difficult quickly. Peter Weiss hits the nail on the head,

   <blockquote>
     Cultural work was Coppi's term for the transition from the enclosure in the factory to the openess of the night school class, for getting there was the achievement, it had to succeed, it had to overcome the exhaustion that tried to hold us back. More than half the participants dropped out after the first few sessions. The foreheads striking the desks, beaten down by twelve hours, were made of lead by seven P.M. The school system took these casualties into account, the survivours held their eyes open with their fingers, gaped at the blurring blackboards, pinched themselves in the arm, scribbled up their notebooks, and during the final phase more participants dropped out, they only had to lose a week because of apartment hunting, job hunting, because of an accident or simply because of discouragement, and they were yanked out of the class.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
