  <h1>Open Source Software</h1>



  <p>
    I found my way to open-source after my self enforced rest from the music industry. I came to music software in the late nineties when invited to see a collegues setup. Entering his bedsit, I saw a large table with a computer and some other bits at the end of his bed. This was my first experience with a computer since rudimentry IT classes with BBC Acorn<sup><a href="#fn1" id= "ref1">1</a></sup> and my Sinclair Spectrum<sup><a href="#fn2" id= "ref2">2</a></sup> many years before that.



    
  </p>

  <p>
   He switched on the machines and loaded something on the computer, hit the spacebar, and music pounded from the speakers. We played around for a while, making something that could be loosely classed as music. Months passed, and I  acquired my own computer by hire purchase. My colleague handed over some compact discs filled with cracked software. This was around the year 1998. I continued using cracked software, using P2P<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> in an attempt to get hold of the latest passwords or software. To be brutally honest, it was more about consumption of products than making music (commonly known as Gear Acquisition Syndrome). It was a few years until I could afford to purchase software. A copy of Logic Pro Audio (an industry standard digital audio workstation) was around £500 back then.
  </p>




  <p>
   At some point, I began to search for a way to make my own audio plugins. To create music without being <a href="oppression.html">forced into purchasing more tools that make me sound like everyone else</a>. In "best free software packages" lists in music magazines, I read about SuperCollider<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, but the cons always mentioned the steep learning curve, so I shied away from it. At the time, I had bought a couple of records by the artist Cylob. I was impressed how his music sounded like nothing else. After researching, I found he had built his own software with Supercollider. The Cylob Music System 3000. He also said that "although it had a much steeper learning curve, was much more flexible in terms of sound patching and generation."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
  </p>
  




  <p>
    I downloaded and opened the software. I was greeted with a small, blank, white window and not much else. I closed it immediately and forgot about it for about year where I did the same again. I made slow progress. Working, getting stuck and quitting tutorials was the norm. Looking through  mailing lists for tips but having no idea what was happening. This was my first time programming. I was working alone. I did not know any programmers. I had no reference what it was to program and how difficult it would be. I did not post questions to the mailing lists as the answers that came back were even more complicated. Even though the lists were friendly, they felt like a place of an <a href="oppression.html">assumption of knowledge</a>, and, for me, even more excluding. This was my first exposure to open-source software and the community. Users were freely sharing code and programs built on the platform. I spent lots of time using other people's programs, with the idea that I could hack into their code or, at the very least, see their code and see how something was built. </p>

   Paulo Friere writes <a href="oppression.html"> "Freedom is aquired by contest, not by gift".</a><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
I have been finding this over the last 17 or so years whilst using the software intermittently, sometimes with massive breaks, as I found learning challenging. In the early days of this software, resources were scarce. Knowledge, for the working classes, is something that is fought for, not given. As a youth, how can it be whilst living a chaotic home life, working before or after school, hungry, and having no help with homework whilst at home? Even as an adult, with the chance to return to education, things can become difficult quickly. Peter Weiss hits the nail on the head,

   <blockquote>
     Cultural work was Coppi's term for the transition from the enclosure in the factory to the openess of the night school class, for getting there was the achievement, it had to succeed, it had to overcome the exhaustion that tried to hold us back. More than half the participants dropped out after the first few sessions. The foreheads striking the desks, beaten down by twelve hours, were made of lead by seven P.M. The school system took these casualties into account, the survivours held their eyes open with their fingers, gaped at the blurring blackboards, pinched themselves in the arm, scribbled up their notebooks, and during the final phase more participants dropped out, they only had to lose a week because of apartment hunting, job hunting, because of an accident or simply because of discouragement, and they were yanked out of the class.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
   </blockquote>

   <p>
     This approach is like working twice. Creating tools to create work is challenging, especially when supporting yourself and trying to work on this in the limited spare time available. Projects take much longer. Are more fraught with setbacks. However, the payoffs can be greater. Building tools unique to the user. Programming skills can cross over. The power of open-source is that users can freely <a href="interlocuters.html">share software and code</a> and further extend and modify tools. The remarkable thing is not being <a href="oppression.html">forced into a particular working method</a>. It allows the user to create their way of working. One problem with this approach is the hope that the open-source software is maintained and documented. But, as previously mentioned, the user can access the source code and begin to figure out how it runs and works, fix possible bugs. Friere's theory in work. It is happening as you work through this. The user is self-educating in an area previously inaccessible. One payoff (especially working in SuperCollider) is that the file sizes are petite due to being text files, allowing easy storage,backup and the unique <a href="communityarts.html">possibilities of collaboration</a> with people from different cities and countries. I coded a granular synth tool, and the file size is only four kilobytes. What's not to love?
