**  It seems also important to situate yourself and your practice. where are you speaking from? How your history
constitutes a trajectory for your work and the question you ask.

Where Do I locate myself?
I'm really not sure. I know that I do not locate myself with my cohort. I have no interest in what they are doing or making or even thinking about. I know that I am not a "Fine Artist"(whatever the hell a fine artist is?). I don't ask the same questions. I don't feel the same things. I don't have the same experiences.
I feel that everyone around me has interest in things that I don't care about. I don't particularly care about the technology. I don't particullarly care about cutting edge things. I don't care about AI. I don't care about cutting edge computer graphics. I don't particularrly care about the theory. I find it to be bullshit. It's feels as though it is just an extension of the hyper-aggressive narcesisstic society we live in.

In the past 10 years since completing my batchelors degree I have mainly been working in the audio field. I managed to avoid working in this field as a paid professional but as an "artist" working on my own skills. Before my degree I was interested in using computers to create work with, but soon, this transitioned into playing and learning more as an instrumentalist as early on I realised that it would be easier for me to play with other people, than for people to play with me. I wasn't fortunate enough to have had music lessons as a young child, unlike the cohort through my degree (I was already more than ten years older than many of my contemporaries). I couldn't read music. 
I could barely play a musical instrument. I hadn't been in an ensemble for over 10 years. I took to positining myself as an experimental computational composer (much to the laughter of my entire cohort as I introduced myself as a laptop musician). This was my first, bitter taste of eliteism and classism thoughout my academic and music career.

    <strong>The following bit taken from the my story org file</strong>

My story

- I should write something here that helps with where I situate myself.


I really don't know where to start?
 maybe right now?

 I'm currently 3/4 of my way through my MFA in computational arts. I don't know why I'm doing this course. It was a reccomendation from a aquantence who suggested i did this course for a Masters when I Asked him about the University of Huddersfield

 I'm currently approaching 50 years. I'm actually 47 years old. I just outlived my father, who died at the age of 46/47 from bowel cancer in 1982/83. I spend my entire life thinking I would be dead by now so I thought "what's the point" for pretty much all of my life. I droped out of high school at 15 as i had a serious problem with authority and I just didn't see the point of school in general. I didn't fit in with anyone or anthing that was happening at the time (this was the early to mid 90's. I dropped out in 94). I worked jobs I thought were cool at the time (mainly a bartender, slinging drinks), whilst the majority of the people I was in school with did the usual thing (university, job, marriage, homeowner, kids etc). I bumped around from dead end job, to dead end job, working nighthifts in printers, plastic factories and supermarkets trying to live enouh to go get drunk enough. I attempted a "retrain" in my mid 20's, where I moved (read as ran away from my problems) cities to attend a music college for a year. 




 Something about my moving away from traditional softwares and machines to trying to build my own. Open source, free, 
I found that after working in studios that my digital skills were non transferrable. Noone cared that I could make beats, basslines and chords in a Digital Audio Workstaion. i attempted to teach myself to code, to free myself from the tyranny of gear aquistion syndrome. The road was long and hard, I fell from the horse multple times. being self taught was difficult. I had no mentors. Working from tutorials that presumed knowledge. I grew angry at this. The lore of presumend knowledge was high. i guess a lot of these resources were targeted at university students studying computer science or computational arts/music of some sort. I had non of this. I didn't even have any GCSE's at the time (I was 28 at this point) and was just about to be introduced to a mythical place called "Art School".

i managed to get onto a access to art and design at Leeds College of Art by (silently) refusing to work whilst I was signing on the dole. I had been made redundant two or three years earlier from my role as a finisher at a cloth mill (I had taken this job after working as a recording studio assistant and burning out due to intense workplace bullying and a pre-disposotioned addiction to alchohol and drugs)

- this is bullshit and full of assumption and is my own bias against others. so just leave it out. But it feels good to write it down.
  - I feel as though I'm surrounded by relatively privalaged poeple at least half my age(when I say privaliged I am making an assumption regarding this. This assumption comes from the fact that there must be some kind of help to be able to move to one of the most expensive capital cities on the planet, study full time for one or two years with no job. Where does the money come for rent, bills, food, transport etc? ). People with privalage they don't even know they have. I Have it. I am by no means devoid of any privalage.

- probably also bullshit that isn't needed
 - I'm a middle aged, white man with a university education in the arts, currently studying a MFA.  My path to this point was not similar to the usual path walked by friends my age who went to university following the usual route of an UK based student (high-school, sixth form college, university). I was a high school dropout, leaving school as early as I could, with no qualifications, I worked menial jobs for many years.

- even more unnessasary bullshit
 - It feels as though I am stuck with the affordability of things. Fair enough, I managed to upgrade my laptop before this university program began and I spent a lot of money on it, but I worked hard for 2 or three months solid, working up to 18 hrs a day to do it. Even putting myself through this program, I have to try and work up to 40 hours a week whilst commuting around 16 hrs a week to university just to be able to pay for the program, the transport and the usual living costs of a peron in their mid 40's. I'm not cash rich, or time rich. I don't get to be able to work on things in my own time as my own time is either recovery time from the work/travel commitments noted above. I feel that I'm one of the only people in my cohort (I've seen three different cohorts at this point of time in my part time program)
