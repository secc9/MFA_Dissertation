  <h2>What is culture</h2>



    <p>This is a sentence with a footnote.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

    "If a man without books or reading, or reading nothing but his letters and the newspapers, gets nevertheless a fresh and free play of the best thoughts upon his stock notions and habits, he has got culture. He has got that for which we prize and recommend culture; he has got that which at the present moment we seek culture that it may give us. This inward operation is the very life and essence of culture, as we conceive it/Nevertheless, it is not easy so to frame one's discourse concerning the operation of culture, as to avoid giving frequent occasion to a misunderstanding whereby the essential inwardness of the operation is lost sight of."<sup>[1]</sup> - pg 5 - Culture and Anarchy - Arnold, Matthew.

  <p>
    Arnold differenciates between indoctination of religion and politics and offers that culture "It seeks to do away with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and light, where they may use ideas , as it uses them itself, freely - nourished and not bound by them." [2] -pg 6  - Culture and Anarchy - Arnold, Matthew.

  <h2>What is class?</h2>

  
  
  <p>

    

    
I'm very much English working class.
It's important to distiguish where I am from, because being working class in the UK is a very different thing from being working class in Colombia. I use Colombia as an example as my partners immidiate family is lower, lower working class Colombian and the two things are not the same. The UK still (just about) has a safety net for the poor. I myself have spent various times of my life signing on for unemployment benefits. In Colombia there is no such thing. If you do not have money or the ability to earn it, you are left behing and are likely to starve.
