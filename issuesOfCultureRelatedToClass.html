  <p>
I'm very much English working class.
It's important to distiguish where I am from, because being working class in the UK is a very different thing from being working class in Colombia. I use Colombia as an example as my partners immidiate family is lower, lower working class Colombian and the two things are not the same. The UK still (just about) has a safety net for the poor. I myself have spent various times of my life signing on for unemployment benefits. In Colombia there is no such thing. If you do not have money or the ability to earn it, you are left behing and are likely to starve.
