  <h2>What is culture</h2>

    "If a man without books or reading, or reading nothing but his letters and the newspapers, gets nevertheless a fresh and free play of the best thoughts upon his stock notions and habits, he has got culture. He has got that for which we prize and recommend culture; he has got that which at the present moment we seek culture that it may give us. This inward operation is the very life and essence of culture, as we conceive it/Nevertheless, it is not easy so to frame one's discourse concerning the operation of culture, as to avoid giving frequent occasion to a misunderstanding whereby the essential inwardness of the operation is lost sight of."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> - pg 5 - Culture and Anarchy - Arnold, Matthew.
  </p>

  According to Arnold, culture is something that man (and I would assume, woman) fosters and 'cultures' for themselves. Even with the minimum of external world input, a person can look anew at the things they are doing and realign their thinking along this path. The action of looking inward

    Arnold differenciates between indoctination of religion and politics and offers that culture "It seeks to do away with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and light, where they may use ideas , as it uses them itself, freely - nourished and not bound by them." [2] -pg 6  - Culture and Anarchy - Arnold, Matthew.

  <p>"the men of culture are the true apostles of equality" - pg 6

  "cultural studies argues that culture's importance derives from the fact that it helps to constitute the structure and shape the history" [3] - pg xv - introduction - Storey, John

  " Popular culture is made by subordinate peoples in their own interests out od resources that also, contradictorily, serve ther economic interests of the dominant"[4] - pg xvii Fisk(1989a)

  "Hoggart never quite says it, but the implication is there: popular culture is is culture made popular by jordinary working people." - pg 22 -   Cultural Theory and Popular Culture 


  The working class make the culture. The working class generally would be the ones to spend their wages on the things they like or that interest them. It is known that the middle/upper classes generally save or invest their money as they are interested in making money, not culture. Spening money on interests creates a need for culture. and thus the culture growns around this.

  In only reading the introduciton to the book Cultural theory and popular culture, it is clear that there is an entwinment of not only groups creating culture but also the interjection of commercial influence. After all, capitalism has to thrive and where
  better than in the pockets of the youth with a disposable income.

"They are ground between the millstones of technocracy and democracy; society gives them almost a limitless freedom of the sensations, but makes few demands on them - the use of their hands and a fraction of their brains for fourty hours per week" - pg 28 - Cultural theory and popular culture - Hoggart, R. 1990, The uses of literacy, London: Chatto& Windus, pp. 246-500

These 'youth' Hoggard speaks of have generally had nothing to do. have nothing provided, so ultmatly have to make their own entertainment. In the home it's possible there are no books. My home had an encycolpedia and maybe my older brothers book on ornothology. With no familial support of care to read beyond what is given during schooling, or even, in fact, something far different to what the school system is doling out, is it any wonder that hoardes of working class children grow into fodder for the capitalist machine. Educated just enough to be able to follow through with instructions on how to make a commodity but not educated enough to question the reason for this existence they are forced into.

Raymond Williams Suggests that the third catagory in the three definitions of culture is the social definition, " in which culture is a description of a particular way of life, which expresses certain meanings and values not only in art and learning but also in institutions and ordinary behaviour" - pg 29 Cultural Theory and Popular Culture - Williams, Raymond. 1961, The Long Revolution, London: Chatto & Windus, pp.57-70

  <h2>What is class?</h2>




  <h2>This is some kind of weaving from my own beginnings, before I was "educated" to where I am now. and the things I am doing. From drinking and working all day, to now educating myself and attempting to create art to help others.

I'm very much English working class.
It's important to distiguish where I am from, because being working class in the UK is a very different thing from being working class in Colombia. I use Colombia as an example as my partners immidiate family is lower, lower working class Colombian and the two things are not the same. The UK still (just about) has a safety net for the poor. I myself have spent various times of my life signing on for unemployment benefits. In Colombia there is no such thing. If you do not have money or the ability to earn it, you are left behing and are likely to starve.
