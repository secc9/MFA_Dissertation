  This dissertation explores the act of creating and distributing open source audio tools. This simple notion is in itself an act of resistance and rebellion in the face of post capitalist structures and labour forces. By eschewing the now traditional routes of digital artistic production we can hopefully find that it is possible to travel along another path, one much less well troden, but all the more fulfilling because of that fact. By travelling this path, the user will hopefully find themselves armed with a multiude of tools that will help them hack away at the jungle in front of them, and in time, emerging at the foot of a great clearing.

This following dissertation may or may not be split into sections for the reader to choose their own way through it. Think of this more like a "choose your own adventure" book than a traditional essay. This style aligns with my own style of thought and learning. It never has been straight forward. It's been often said to me "Why don't you just act normally!" or "What the hell is wrong with you? Why don't you just focus on one thing?". Maybe that has to do with some underlying, undiagnosed neurodiversity problems. Maybe it was the lack of oxygen to my brain as I was born with the umbillical cord wrapped around my neck multiple times. Or maybe I'm just wierd and I don't work in the way that everyone else does? I lost many hours in school (and still now in my masters program) having no idea what was or in fact is going on as I have very little interest in it. Or maybe it's the way that the teaching is delivered? For some reason I tend to choose things that are hard for me and that I have no interest in as I feel that it will be better for me in the long run, but I just end up hating everything I do throught the time I have forced myslef into doing the thing. 
I vaguelly recall writer [[id:ABF70730-7CB1-4A1D-BB26-D7BA6858D780][Robert Twigger]] writing in one of his books that when he met a monk the monk mentioned that learning and knowledge is a circular phenomenon, going round in loose circles, overlapping each other when the circle come back round again. If you look at this circle on a different axis the circle becomes a funnel, expanding up as your knowlege gets broader and broader.
