The usual Marxist stuff here.

  <p>

I myself have spent much of my life working in lower class positions. positions that don't come with a university degree. I myself worked as a grill chef, bartender, shelf stacker, mill worker, factory assembler, data entry and building caretaker among others. Having been a high school drop out, I didn't really care for or know much about the world of careers. In these positions you are labour for the process of commodities. You hire your labour (or starve) for the going rate. You ae paid the lowest the employer can get away with, whilst at the same time, the owner sellls the comoddities for as much as they can get. Marx terms this profit as stolen labour. - find reference

I, only recently was working for an employer who was happiliy under paying staff wages even so far as getting reported and investigated for it.
