<h1>Exploitation of Labour</h1>





<h3>
"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles" - Karl Marx[1]
</h3>





<p>
  
    I have spent much of my life working in what could be termed lower class positions. Positions that don't require a university degree. Dropping out of high school at the age of fifteen would guarantee this. Having some kind of inbuilt distain for authority whilst posessing an inherent laziness for any particular kind of work has solidified this even deeper. At an early age, (11) I was earning my own money as well as attempting to contribute to our single parent household. I was working after school as a butchers assistant, washing up sharp knives, being elbow deep in bloody liver and standing on boxes because I was too short to work the mincer and earning Â£10 per week for the honor. This kind of thing continued onwards for many years. I have been the following (in no particular order and by no means a complete list), grill chef, bartender, shelf stacker, mill worker, factory worker, data entry clerk, studio engineer, postal worker, building caretaker, pot washer and DJ, among others. I could be classed as a minimum wage warrior, but my most recent gig (DJ/Events) pays (quite) a bit more. But for the most part of it, yes, sure, a minimum wage warrior. Many of the positions came through agency work. Getting moved on from positions for showing "a lack of enthusiasm". Could you have any enthusiasm working twelve hour night shifts whilst watching and boxing plastic mouldings for popular vacuum cleaners. I once got repremanded for letting all my work pile up whilst reading American Psycho. Apparently it wasn't within my abilities to read and work at the same time? I had to watch and wait for the huge machine to pop out a little plastic mould which I would then move and stack into a box to be taken to the assembly line. Henry Ford has a lot to answer for for the depression of milliions of people I'm sure I recall once walking into an agency and asking for a position with the least amoount of resposibility possible and I walked out with a pot washing position at the local science laboratries on the outskirts of town. The only thing the positions had in common was that I was the proletariat. The oppressed. Although at the time I didn't knopw it intelectually, but I knew it somewhere in my bones. this was in my early twenties. By this point I had already had maybe 15 / 20 different jobs. I had managed to keep work and work my way up a little, but alwasy I had been kept at a certain point. I was given more responibility, but with little or no finincial renumeration to show this was happening.

    Having been a high school drop out, I didn't really care for or know much about the world of careers. I tried early on, but soon realsised you do a lot of work for nothing, or for someone to take the credit, or even for someone to tell you that an idea is not very good, only for them to have the idea two or three years later, but I'm sure we've all experienced that.<br><br>
    maybe this is also down to an education and class thing. if you have been brought up in a positionof power, then you can legitimatly stand up for yourself, if you have alwasy been in the position of the oppressed, then the ability to stand up for yourself has been taken away, the threat of work or starve is in place. And the opressor knows this.

    it has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones." [3]-pg 4

  Not much has changed, we (I use the royal we here. I found that other socio-economic classes (the ones above mine generally), see themselves as above the unwashed. They have a semi-detached house, nice car, regular overseas holidays, but, they are still in the position of the <a href="oppression.html">oppressed</a>, but for some reason they cannot see it. their trappings has made them believe they are above everyone else, they have bought into the propaganda of capitalism. They are more under the tight screw of the opressor than the so called layabout, chain smoking, daytime television watching  ), the proletariat, the oppressed, are still being oppressed. We are still answerable to an entity who holds all of the cards. We are sold, under capitalism, that we have the freedom of choice. In a short youtube exerpt the writer Noam Chomsky retorts to an interviewer that states that
  Interviewer: "The right-wing libertarian argument will be "well  you're free to leave at any time".
  Chomsky: "yes, you're free to starve, that's exactly right. You have a choice between starving or selling yourself to a tyranny. Very libertarian."[5]

  I have been in and am still working in positions at the age of almost 50 where managers and employers still feel that it is ok to scream, shout and swear at me when something went wrong. Maybe they aren't taking into account they are paying me so little that I do not actually care if said thing goes right or not.

"Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, opressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted , now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes."[2] - pg1

Go find the richest man in babylon.
Something about how slaves still had their own lives, but could work their way and buy themselves out of poverty. Pretty much no change, but new we are slaves to capitalism, rent, bills and starvation. We have to be slaves to whoever our employer is, be it empl=yed or selkf employed, you still have someone you need to answer to. Someone paying for your skills. So you still need to impress and please the person holding the money.

    I found that in most employment positions, no matter where you are in the whole system, you are generally there to serve someone else.  In these positions you are labour for the process of commodities. You hire your labour (or starve) for the going rate. You ae paid the lowest the employer can get away with, whilst at the same time, the owner sellls the comoddities for as much as they can get. Marx terms this profit as stolen labour. - find reference

I, only recently was working for an employer who was happiliy under paying staff wages even so far as getting reported and investigated for it.
