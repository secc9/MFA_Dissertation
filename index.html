  This dissertation explores the act of creating and distributing <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open-source</a> audio tools, saving and reusing cheap or obsolete music midi controllers <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and the politics surrounding it. Much like the notion that growing your own food is one of the most radical things you can do, this simple notion of open source and recycling, is an act of resistance and rebellion in the face of post-capitalist structures, labour forces and the industry complex inherent in these constructs.  By eschewing the now traditional (read as prescribed, forced, given) routes of digital artistic production, we can hopefully find that the users of these technologies can travel along another path, albeit one much less well-trodden, but all the more fulfilling. When beginning to travel this path, the user will be empty-handed and almost naked. However, along the way, they will slowly find themselves becoming equipped with tools and armour that will help them hack away and protect themselves from the jungle in front of them and, in time, emerge at the foot of a great clearing, where they can construct their village or town, much like Macondo<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. Here, the inhabitants are free (for the time being) to create and live how they wish without the interference from external power.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
</p>

  <p>
 Much like any other industry, the music equipment one it is built on the ideology of capitalism. Larger scale companies even more so. Releasing new technology each cycle, advertised for the consumer to believe that this piece of equipment is the key to finally unlock the creativity hidden deep inside. We may not be our problem? Maybe the vast amount of propaganda<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> we are force-fed daily is? The procurement of new equipment is not the answer. The answer may be the tools which we are already working with. It could something more than that? Equipment is usually expensive to purchase, and once it stops working, then what? Sell it? Recycle it (ending in landfill)? Or throw it in the river and be done?
  </p>

  <p>
    The first of these solutions I have done it myself, selling to a high street chain, without much testing or questioning, never receiving reasonable remuneration. What about the opposite? Purchase something affordable at the cost of four or five coffees from a hip coffee shop? Who cares if it is used? Who cares if it is scrached and scuffed and the decals worn? What does it matter if some of the functions are broken? The item may have some interesting backstory. Some inherent Vudu<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> may lie deep. This could change outcomes, sending the user spiralling in a new direction? What matters is being able to access hardware and use it with some software for a reasonable cost without feeling the burden of having to do something with it. The days of synthesizers costing more than a down payment on a mortgage are gone. Access to cheap, used machines is here. We, the consumers, need to break free of our chains and the stranglehold the propaganda machine has on us.

  This following text is split into sections for the reader to choose their own way through it (it was intended to be much larger, but the scope of the dissertation didn't allow it). Think of this more like a "choose your own adventure"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> book than a traditional essay. This style aligns with my own style of thought and learning. It never has been straightforward. Throughout this mostly autoethnographical<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> work you will find embedded links in the text that will take you elsewhere, hopefully on a journey through the rhizome where you will, much like myself, find your own pathway through. Unfortunately I cannot arm you with a machete. You will have to bring and sharpen your own and hack your way through the linking ideas such as <a href = "communityarts.html">community arts and music</a>, <a href="plannedObsolescence.html">planned obsolescence</a>, <a href="oppression.html">oppression</a>, <a href="interlocuters.html">interlocuters</a> and <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open source software</a>.





  I vaguely recall writer Robert Twigger<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> writing that when he met a monk, the monk mentioned that learning and knowledge is a circular phenomena, going around in loose circles and overlapping each other when the circle come back around again. If you look at this circle on a different axis, the circle becomes a funnel, expanding up and out as your knowlege becomes broader and broader.
  I'm a strong believer in that this is how knowledge works. For me at least. I certainly find it very difficult to work in the <a href="oppression.html">banking model</a> of education and I cannot be the only one.

<!-- find some seague between these two-->

    <p id="operatingmanual">The other side of this coin is specialisation. In his classic book, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, Buckminster Fuller writes that the aim of society is for specialisation. "We find it socially easier to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specializations and leave it to others - primarily to the politicians - to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>
      It is seemingly ideal that humans become more and more specialised in their specific knowledge area,
      "But specialization is in fact only a fancy form of slavery wherein the 'expert' is fooled into accepting his slavery by making him feel that in return he is in a socially and culturally preferred, ergo, highly secure, lifelong position."<sup><a href="fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>
 


  
  "Our failures are a consequence of many factors, but possibly one of the most important is the fact that society operates on the theory  that specialization is the key to success, not realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="re11">11</a></sup>





      In the 56 years since Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth was written it only seems more relevent to what we are seeing today. Users are forced out of making their own decisions in the way they want to create, forced down the path of how someone else wants you to do it. Being locked in with anothers way of thinking. This idea that specialisation is preventing a more, wholly rounded approach to thought and creation is strangling the act of making. This could go some way to explaining why things are becoming more and more homogeneous. As more commodities are produced, it would make sense that similarities appear between them as to make them just as appealing to the consumer. 


      For DJ's they HAVE to use the Pioneer brand as that is "industry standard". Graphic designers are forced into using the "Adobe Suite" as, once again, this is deemed "industry standard". Civil engineers are using AutoCad as, again, this is also "industry standard". The need for softwares to be industry standard also could be seen as why the price is so high for these items. Who made these decisions? Also this approach leads to a black market for "pirated software". More and more as time rolls on, we are seeing the introduction of the subscription service. Now you no longer own what you pay for. Renting your software on a monthly or yearly basis is the new standard. The Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis is terming this post-capitalist time as 'Technofeudalism'.
      But this is another story. I want to present another way. As mentioned earlier, the path of <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open source</a>.


  <!--For some reason when it comes to education and getting  qualifications to be able to exist inside of capitalism,  I tend to choose things that are hard for me and that I have no interest in as I feel that it will be better for me in the long run, but I just end up hating everything I do throughout the time I have forced myself into doing the thing.-->

<h3>Not sure what to doo about this bit?</h3>
    You will find my journey here. Most probably also the voices of others, but that is probably also me, but in reality it is the voices of others. The second sentence in A Thousand Plateaus is "Since each of us was several, there was already a crowd".[5] I really like this, It's as if the authors themselves are admitting to the fact that they are working on a network of learned ideas or,  they are in fact bipolar, but either way I'm with them.

     This paper will focus on access to technology. Things that can limit the entrance to making music/sound. Historically, here in the UK, access to music and the arts has been for the more privileged, and the lower classes are made to be happy with their lot. The lower classes manufacture the instruments, and the upper classes use them and produce work to be displayed at functions and concerts that the lower classes cannot afford. They do not even witness the fruits of their labour in action. How does someone from a lower socio-economic background go about changing this? I recently performed at the Leeds Emom<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> festival, the first of its kind. The lineup was mostly middle-aged, white male performers with relatively expensive equipment (myself included). I may have built my own software, but it was still running on a £2500 Apple laptop with a £500 external soundcard. Is it possible to purchase obsolete music controller equipment and write software for it? So what? Why do this? I started this path almost  <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">17 years ago</a>. Looking for ways to create my instruments using coding languages and hardware hacking and the long, eventual break away from traditional software has opened new doors I would have never known about if I had not started on this path.
    </p>

    <p>
      How obsolete is obsolete? When will the actual equipment no longer be able to work or even be supported? This idea is not a new one by any means. Developing countries have long been grafting old components together for repairs and to create their own tools due to a lack of access. DJ Boboss is a young Kenyan DJ doing just this.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Even here in the more upwardly mobile Western countries, there is still a place for vintage guitar and studio equipment, even if there is a lack of people with the skills to repair them. A grandfather is more than likely tinkering away in his shed right now but with no one interested enough for him to pass on his knowledge, we become evermore swallowed up in the closed system of capitalism. The human labour costs for these products are high. The number of people who have touched a product before a purchase can be high, from mining raw materials to factory workers turning materials into components, hardware design, electronics, software, production build, documentation, marketing, and retail. Workers toil for long hours doing boring and repetitive labour to make something they cannot afford. 

    </p>


    <p>
      Consumer cycles and capitalism's model of growth demand <a href="plannedObsolescence.html">new consumption</a>. Accessibility and affordability are entwined. Not everyone has access to modern technology. Even access to a computer is lower than expected. According to the Digital Poverty Alliance, "26%  of young people cannot access a laptop or similar device."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> It can be difficult to purchase things that bring joy when there is little spare money at the end of the week/month, especially when we are stretched to the brink financially. Reuse and recycling can bring old equipment back to life and be a small act of rebellion against the current pollution, climate and political crisis. 
      Whilst working on the project 'On Touch Sanitation', Mierle Laderman Ukeles said about the waste system and the sanitation workers in New York City, "That when you throw something out, there's no 'out'. Rather there's a human being who has to lift it, haul it, get injured because of it, dispose of it. 20,000 tons every day. Our garbage, not theirs".<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
    </p>

    
    <p>
      Where does it go? Sometimes, we can sell it on again. Other times, it is disposed of in the recycling. Where does this then end up? What we are doing is building huge E-Waste sites in the Global South. We seem to be happy to throw it away and replace it as soon as it breaks without thinking about who has to deal with our waste.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> In this act of consumption, we have handed over our knowledge of make and repair for convenience. Let us battle against this. Now is the time for us to teach the next generations to develop a more ethical way of production and creation. Our ancestors have had a time of plenty but did nothing to protect future generations against this. They chopped up the forests to build massive shipping empires but did not think far enough into the future to replenish what they took. Here is a distinct lack of caring for the future and only thinking of the now. We are still in this process of thought. We must now intervene at a grassroots level and interject with new teachings that can benefit future generations. We can teach them to help themselves by freely passing along traditionally guarded knowledge. Opening up the gates to the walled gardens, we can take cuttings from closely guarded species and cross-pollinate with more hardy variations, which will stand us in good stead in the future. A new line of thinking is key. Everyone can have access. A used computer, or even a new, low-powered but affordable machine such as a Raspberry Pi, can suffice. For around £200, a person can easily build an open-source computer running open-source software; the trick is to get past the dumbing down of technology use. Children are smart and quick to pick up new technologies, but with operating systems being closed down alongside migration from handheld devices, there is no understanding of how things are working, even to the fundamental level of file management.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> This needs to change. In my computing program, I have witnessed the <a href="desktops.html">cluttered desktops</a> of my cohort's computers, and it is enough to send my heart into rapid palpitations.I digress. With <a href="communityarts.html">alternative education</a>, we could see an expansion and an acceptance of more experimental forms of arts from younger people who are out of the realm of the arts. What is needed is how to figure this out and to make it more mainstream and accessible, with students owning their means of production, but the more people explore this, the more acceptable it becomes.

  I use the term propaganda here in what I know to be the Latin American use for it. I was once informed by my one time Colombian housemate Jiaro that we had "received the proganda in the mail".

I was suprised by the usage of the term as I had never heard it used like this before, but he explained that all marketing in Latin America is termed this way. This now makes complete sense to me.
