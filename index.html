  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <h2>Bringing the dead back to life. 
    Attempting to save affordable and disposable music controllers from oblivion.</h2><br>
  <h2>Ashley Sagar</h2>
  

<p>

  This dissertation explores the act of creating and distributing <a href="openSourceSoftware.html"> open source</a> audio tools, along with saving and reusing cheap or obsolete music midi controllers[1] as well as the politics surrounding it.  This simple notion of open source is in itself an act of resistance and rebellion in the face of post capitalist structures and labour forces. By eschewing the now traditional routes of digital artistic production we can hopefully find that it is possible for the users of these technologies to travel along another path, albeit one much less well troden, but all the more fulfilling because of that fact. When beginning to travel this path, the user will be empty handed and almost naked, but along the way they will slowly find themselves  with a multiude of tools and armour that will help them hack away at the jungle in front of them, and in time, emerging at the foot of a great clearing, where they can build their own village or town, much like the town of Macondo[2], where the inhabitants are free (for the timebeing) to create and live how they wish without the inteference from an external power.

    The music equipment industry is much like every other industry. One built on the ideology of capitalism. Larger scale companies even more so. Releasing new technology each cycle, advertised to make the user believe that this piece of equipment will be the key piece that will finally unlock and unleash the creativity hidden deep inside the creator’s unconsciousness. Maybe it isn't the equipment? Maybe it's the tools which we are already working with. Maybe it is something more than that? Equipment is usually expensive to purchase, and once it stops working. Then what? Hopefully, sell it? Throw it out and continue adding to landfills, or throw it in the river? 
    The former of these is a valid thing as I have done it myself, selling to a high street store that takes belongings without much testing or questioning, hoping to, but never receiving a reasonable remuneration. Why not do the opposite? Why not purchase something affordable at the cost of maybe four or five coffees from a popular, hip coffee shop? Who cares if the casing is battered? What does it matter if some of the functions are broken? What matters is being able to access the hardware and use it with some software for a reasonable cost, without feeling the overwhelming burden of having to do something with it, as it costs more than two months’ rent and bills. Gone are the days of synthesizers costing more than a down payment on a mortgage.

    This work is a somewhat autoethnographic[3] journey through parts of my life. I feel it is better to try and tell this work through my own story as I feel I'm well placed to be able to tell it, instead of as some kind of dry, passive voice reeling off facts and cleverly found references because I want to seem smarter than I. Let us not forget the usual drabness of following some institutiuion recommended rubric to squeeze as many marks out of the work as possible. In my hubris and misguided judment I will probably not even look at the hubris once. Why break the habit of a lifetime eh? The words of my first teacher at art school still ring in my ears. "Don't chase the marks. Do the work, the marks will follow". A few friends and I would always joke about how tepid the work was of people trying to chase marks. It seemed more interested in getting an A than anything else. Although I'm sure they are all laughing now as they are in full employment whilst we (read as I) are still struggling with finding work as we (I) can never make anything to order.

<h3>Not sure what to doo about this bit?</h3>
    You will find my journey here. Most probably also the voices of others, but that is probably also me, but in reality it is the voices of others. The second sentence in A Thousand Plateaus is "Since each of us was several, there was already a crowd".[4] I really like this, It's as if the authors themselves are admitting to the fact that they are working on a network of learned ideas or,  they are in fact bipolar, but either way I'm with them.

  This following dissertation is split into sections for the reader to choose their own way through it. Think of this more like a "choose your own adventure"[5] book than a traditional essay. This style aligns with my own style of thought and learning. It never has been straight forward. It's been often said to me "Why don't you just act normally!" or "What the hell is wrong with you? Why don't you just focus on one thing?". Maybe that has to do with some underlying, undiagnosed neurodiversity problems. Maybe it was the lack of oxygen to my brain as I was born with the umbillical cord wrapped around my neck multiple times. Or maybe I'm just weird and I don't work in the way that everyone else does? I lost many hours in school (and through my bachelors degree, and still now in my masters program) having no idea what was or in fact is going on as I have very little interest in it. My mother recites the same story to me of the time she was a child. "I used to stare out of the window at school and think about getting home and making rabbit hutches or runs for the chickens." I'm positive that there is some thread of undiagnosed ADHD or something going on. Or could it be the way that the <a href="oppression.html">teaching is delivered?</a> For some reason when it comes to education and getting  qualifications to be able to exist inside of capitalism,  I tend to choose things that are hard for me and that I have no interest in as I feel that it will be better for me in the long run, but I just end up hating everything I do throughout the time I have forced myself into doing the thing.

<h2>This doesnt flow from one section into the next</h2>

I vaguelly recall writer Robert Twigger[6] writing in one of his books that when he met a monk the monk mentioned that learning and knowledge is a circular phenomenon, going round in loose circles, overlapping each other when the circle come back round again. If you look at this circle on a different axis the circle becomes a funnel, expanding up as your knowlege gets broader and broader.
I'm a strong believer in this and how knowledge works.
- Something here about Myelin
  - need to find a source. but its a real thing for sure.
  The scientific version of this is something called myelin, A fatty insulating sheath that wraps itsself around the neron pathways in the brain, making the pathway wider and therfore easier to recall learnt patterns, facts, musical passages through repetition.

Throught the work you will find embedded links in the text that will take you elsewhere, hopefully on a journey through the rhizome where you will, much like myself, find your own pathway through. Unfortunatly I cannot arm you with a machete. You will have to bring, sharpen and hack your way through the linking ideas such as post capitalist labour, <a href = "communityarts.html">community arts and music</a>, <a href="plannedObsolescence.html">planned obsolescence</a>, <a href="locateMyself.html">where I locate myself</a>, <a href="exploitationOfLabour.html">exploitation of workers and labor</a>, <a href="issuesOfCultureRelatedToClass.html">issues of culture related to class</a>, <a href="degrowth.html">degrowth</a>, <a href="communityarts.html">community arts and music</a>, <a href="oppression.html">oppression</a>, <a href="interlocuters.html">interlocuters</a>, <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open source software</a>,

I cannot have been the only child to read these books to have kept many fingers in pages whilst I figured out my way to survive through the adventure.<br><br>
