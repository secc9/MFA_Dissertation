<p>

  This dissertation explores the act of creating and distributing <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open source</a> audio tools, saving and reusing cheap or obsolete music midi controllers <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and the politics surrounding it. This simple notion of open source is an act of resistance and rebellion in the face of post-capitalist structures, labour forces and the industry complex inherent in these constructs. By eschewing the now traditional (read as prescribed, forced, given) routes of digital artistic production, we can hopefully find that the users of these technologies can travel along another path, albeit one much less well-trodden, but all the more fulfilling because of that fact. When beginning to travel this path, the user will be empty-handed and almost naked. However, along the way, they will slowly find themselves becoming equipped with a multitude of tools and armour that will help them hack away and protect themselves from the jungle in front of them and, in time, emerge at the foot of a great clearing, where they can construct their village or town, much like Macondo<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. Here the inhabitants are free (for the time being) to create and live how they wish without the interference from external power. 
</p>

  <p>
    The music equipment industry is much like any other industry. One built on the ideology of capitalism. Larger scale companies even more so. Releasing new technology each cycle, advertised to make the user believe that this piece of equipment will be the key piece that will finally unlock and unleash the creativity hidden deep inside the creator's unconsciousness.  Maybe we aren't the problem? Maybe the huge amount of propaganda<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> we are force-fed on a daily basis is? Maybe new equipment isn't the answer? Maybe the answer lies the tools which we are already working with. Maybe it's something more than that? Equipment is usually expensive to purchase, and once it stops working. Then what? Hopefully, sell it. Pop it into the recycling bin and continue adding it to landfills? Or maybe just throw it in the river and be done with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first of these solutions is a valid thing as I have done it myself, selling to a high street chain that takes belongings without much testing or questioning, whilst hoping to, but never receiving a reasonable remuneration. What about the opposite of this? Why not purchase something affordable at the cost of maybe four or five coffees from a popular, hip coffee shop? Who cares if it has been used? Who cares if the casing is battered? What does it matter if some of the functions are broken? Maybe the item has some interesting backstory that the new owner would never know about. Maybe there is some inherent Vudu deep within the piece that would change outcomes and outputs for the new owner and send them spiralling in a new direction? What matters is being able to access hardware and use it with some software for a reasonable cost without feeling the overwhelming burden of having to do something with it, or even stick with it for the forseeable future. Gone are the days of synthesizers costing more than a down payment on a mortgage. Access to cheap, used machines is here. We, the consumers, just need to break free of our chains and the stranglehold the propaganda machine has on us.

    This work is a somewhat autoethnographic[4] journey through parts of my life. I feel it is better to try and tell this work through my own story as I feel I'm well placed to be able to tell it, instead of as some kind of dry, passive voice reeling off facts and cleverly found references because I want to come across smarter than I am. I cannot help but feel that following some institution recommended rubric to squeeze as many marks out of the work as possible also squeezes the life out of any work. In an effort to hit the points, the work becomes devoid of personality and shades of color. In my hubris and misguided judment I will probably not even look at the rubric once. Why break the habit of a lifetime? The words of my first teacher at art school still ring in my ears. "Don't chase the marks. Do the work, the marks will follow". A few friends and I would always joke about how tepid the work was of people trying to chase marks. It seemed more interested in getting an A than anything else. Although I'm sure they are all laughing now as they are in full employment whilst we (read as I) are still struggling with finding work as we (I) can never make anything to order.

  This following text is split into sections for the reader to choose their own way through it. Think of this more like a "choose your own adventure"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> book than a traditional essay. This style aligns with my own style of thought and learning. It never has been straightforward.<!-- MAybe Footnote this part??--> <!--It's been often said to me "Why don't you just act normally!" or "What the hell is wrong with you? Why don't you just focus on one thing?". Maybe that has to do with some underlying, undiagnosed neurodiversity problems. Maybe it was the lack of oxygen to my brain as I was born with the umbillical cord wrapped around my neck multiple times. Or maybe I'm just weird and I don't work in the way that everyone else does? I lost many hours in school (and through my bachelors degree, and still now in my masters program) having no idea what was or in fact is going on as I have very little interest in it. My mother recites the same couple of stories to me of the times she was a child. "I used to stare out of the window at school and think about getting home and making rabbit hutches or runs for the chickens." or "There was one time at school when I questioned the religous education teacher regarding the truth of something in the bible and he slapped me across the face. From that day on I never paid any more attention at school". I purpuosly drip the capital from the bible as this book has caused many problems to many people across history  --> Maybe I have some undiagnosed neurodiversity problems. Or could it be the way that the <a href="oppression.html">teaching is delivered?</a>

  I vaguely recall writer Robert Twigger<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> writing in one of his books that when he met a monk the monk mentioned that learning and knowledge is a circular phenomenon, going round in loose circles, overlapping each other when the circle come back round again. If you look at this circle on a different axis, the circle becomes a funnel, expanding up and out as your knowlege becomes broader and broader.
  I'm a strong believer in that this is how knowledge works. For me at least. I certainly find it very difficult to work in the banking model of education and I cannot be the only one.

  <!-- find some seague between these two-->
    <p>On the other hand is specialisation. In his classic book, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, Buckminster Fuller writes that the aim of society is for specialisation. "We find it socially easier to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specializations and leave it to others-primarily to the polititions-to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas."-pg 21 - operating manual
      It is an ideal that humans become more and more specialised in their specific knowledge area. Fuller was certain that this is the death knell of humans and specialisation it would eventually lead to extinction much like many variety of animal life that have 



  <!--here ........-->


  "But specialization is in fact only a fancy form of slavery wherein the 'expert' is fooled into accepting his slavery by making him feel that in return he is in a socially and culturally preferred, ergo, highly secure, lifelong position."-pg 41 -spaceship earth


  
  "our failures are a consequence of many factors, but possibly one of the most important is the fact that society operates on the theory  that spesialization os the key to success, not realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> -pg 24




  


  
 "We find it socially easier to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specializations and leave it to others [...] to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>-pg21.

  In the 56 years since Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth was written it only seems more relevent to what we are seeing today. Users are forced out of making their own decisions in the way they want to create, forced down the path of how someone else wants you to do it. being locked in with anothers way of thinking. For DJ's they HAVE to use the Pioneer brand as that is "industry standard". Graphic designers are forced into using the "Adobe Suite" as, once again, this is deemed "industry standard". Civil engineers are forced into using AutoCad as once again, this is deemed "industry standard". The need for softwares to be industry standard also could be seen as why the price is so high for these items, which also leads to a black market for "pirated software". But this is another story. I want to present another way. As said before, the path of <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open source</a>


  <!--For some reason when it comes to education and getting  qualifications to be able to exist inside of capitalism,  I tend to choose things that are hard for me and that I have no interest in as I feel that it will be better for me in the long run, but I just end up hating everything I do throughout the time I have forced myself into doing the thing.-->

    You will find my journey here. Most probably also the voices of others, but that is probably also me, but in reality it is the voices of others. The second sentence in A Thousand Plateaus is "Since each of us was several, there was already a crowd".[5] I really like this, It's as if the authors themselves are admitting to the fact that they are working on a network of learned ideas or,  they are in fact bipolar, but either way I'm with them.

Unfortunatly I cannot arm you with a machete.

      <h3>Figure this out?????</h3>

      


      
	I am researching access to technology. Things that can limit the entrance to making music/sound. Historically, access to Music and the arts has been for the more privileged, and the lower classes are made to be happy with their lot. The lower classes manufacture the instruments, and the upper classes use them and produce work to be displayed at functions and concerts that the lower classes cannot afford. 

Is it possible to purchase obsolete music controller equipment and write software for it? So what? Why do this? I started this path almost 17 years ago. looking at a way to make my own instruments using coding languages and the long, eventual break away from traditional software has opened new doors I would have never known about if I hadn’t started on this path. 
How obsolete is obsolete? When will the actual equipment no longer be able to work or maybe even be supported? My idea isn’t a new idea by any means. Developing countries have long been grafting old components together for repairs due to a lack of access. Even here in the more upwardly mobile Western countries, there is still a place for vintage guitar and studio equipment, even if there’s a lack of people with the skills to repair them. 
 	The human labour costs for these products are high. All the people involved in making and even selling a product. This is the labour I'm interested in. The number of people who have touched a product before a purchase can be high. From mining raw materials to factory workers turning materials into components, hardware design, electronics design, software design, production build, documentation, marketing, and retail. What about the human cost of these? Workers working long hours doing repetitive labour to make something they cannot afford. 
      Forgotten technology. Consumer cycles and capitalism’s model of growth demand new consumption. The question of accessibility and affordability can almost go hand in hand Not everyone has access to modern technology. Even access to a computer is lower than expected. xolAccording to the Digital Poverty Alliance, 26% of young people do not have access to a laptop or similar device. It can be difficult to purchase things that can bring joy when there is little spare money at the end of the week/month, especially at this time when everyone is finding themselves stretched to the brink financially. 
 Reuse and recycling can bring old equipment back to life and be a small act of rebellion against the current pollution, climate and political crisis. "That when you throw something out, there's not "out". Rather there's a human being who has to lift it, haul it, get injured because of it, dispose of it". Uklees, 1980. something regarding technology being throw away. Where does it go? Sometime we are able to sell it on again. Other times as it is broken it will be thrown into recycling. Where does this then end up? We are contributing to huge E-Waste sites. Possibly ask questions such as are we so used to disposable tech due to the place it comes from? We seem to be happy to just throw it away and replace it as soon as it breaks. In this act of consumption, we have handed our knowledge of make and repair away for the act of convenience. 
- What are you exploring in your work?
  - what is happening when bringing back these "dead" equipment?
  - the lost voices
    - due to lack of access - another way of viewing it could be -----
      - the option between having only films by Richard Curtis
      - or by as well as having films by Ken Loach
  - What is working class?
    - anyone who earns a wage through labour?
    - I think there are varied privaliges though which possibly need explaining?
      - traditional explanations of working class are of lack of access to things, such as
	- education
	- support
	  - parental
	  - institutional
	- decision making

I believe that it is important to undertake this project for some of the following reasons. To give access to equipment and ideas. Save items from landfill. To give back the chance of the creator of the project to use the project they had a hand in making. To allow for the use and theory of Open Source Software to come forward which in turn allows access to the software so that the user can free themselves of what is being given to them. To attempt to break the 'tradition' of using cracked and pirated software. Allow access to more voices and stories other than the ones we are given.

  I use the term propaganda here in what I know to be the Latin American use for it. I was once informed by my one time Colombian housemate Jiaro that we had "received the proganda in the mail". I was confused, thinking that we had some kind of government leaflet through the post, I picked up the mail which was full of what we here in the UK would call junk mail (leaflets for food delivery, frozen supermaket chains, quadrouple glazing, that kind of thing). I was suprised by the usage of the term as I had never heard it used like this before, but he explained that all marketing in Latin America is termed this way. This now makes complete sense to me. Obviously I quickly adopted the term.
