  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <h2>Bringing the dead back to life. 
    Attempting to save affordable and disposable music controllers from oblivion.</h2><br>
  <h2>Ashley Sagar</h2>
  

<p>

  This dissertation explores the act of creating and distributing <a href="openSourceSoftware.html"> open source</a> audio tools, along with saving and reusing cheap or obsolete music midi controllers[1]  This simple notion is in itself an act of resistance and rebellion in the face of post capitalist structures and labour forces. By eschewing the now traditional routes of digital artistic production we can hopefully find that it is possible to travel along another path, one much less well troden, but all the more fulfilling because of that fact. By travelling this path, the user will hopefully find themselves armed with a multiude of tools that will help them hack away at the jungle in front of them, and in time, emerging at the foot of a great clearing.

  This following dissertation may or may not be split into sections for the reader to choose their own way through it. Think of this more like a "choose your own adventure"[2] book than a traditional essay. This style aligns with my own style of thought and learning. It never has been straight forward. It's been often said to me "Why don't you just act normally!" or "What the hell is wrong with you? Why don't you just focus on one thing?". Maybe that has to do with some underlying, undiagnosed neurodiversity problems. Maybe it was the lack of oxygen to my brain as I was born with the umbillical cord wrapped around my neck multiple times. Or maybe I'm just wierd and I don't work in the way that everyone else does? I lost many hours in school (and still now in my masters program) having no idea what was or in fact is going on as I have very little interest in it. Or maybe it's the way that the teaching is delivered? For some reason I tend to choose things that are hard for me and that I have no interest in as I feel that it will be better for me in the long run, but I just end up hating everything I do throught the time I have forced myself into doing the thing.

I vaguelly recall writer Robert Twigger[3] writing in one of his books that when he met a monk the monk mentioned that learning and knowledge is a circular phenomenon, going round in loose circles, overlapping each other when the circle come back round again. If you look at this circle on a different axis the circle becomes a funnel, expanding up as your knowlege gets broader and broader.
I'm a strong believer in this and how knowledge works.
- Something here about Myelin
  - need to find a source. but its a real thing for sure.
  The scientific version of this is something called myelin, A fatty insulating sheath that wraps itsself around the neron pathways in the brain, making the pathway wider and therfore easier to recall learnt patterns, facts, musical passages through repetition.

Throught the work you will find embedded links in the text that will take you elsewhere, hopefully on a journey through the rhizome where you will, much like myself, find your own pathway through. Unfortunatly I cannot arm you with a machete. You will have to bring, sharpen and hack your way through the linking ideas such as post capitalist labour, <a href = "communityarts.html">community arts and music</a>, <a href="plannedObsolescence.html">planned obsolescence</a>, <a href="locateMyself.html">where I locate myself</a>, <a href="exploitationOfLabour.html">exploitation of workers and labor</a>, <a href="issuesOfCultureRelatedToClass.html">issues of culture related to class</a>, <a href="degrowth.html">degrowth</a>, <a href="communityarts.html">community arts and music</a>, <a href="oppression.html">oppression</a>, <a href="interlocuters.html">interlocuters</a>, <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open source software</a>, 
</p>



  <p>

    You will find my journey here. Most probably also the voices of others, but that is probably also me, but in reality it is the voices of others. The second sentence in A Thousand Plateaus is "Since each of us was several, there was already a crowd".[4] I really like this, It's as if the authors themselves are admitting to the fact that they are working on a network of learned ideas or,  they are in fact bipolar, but either way I'm with them.

  [1] A midi controller is a piece of hardware equiptment that allows a composer and/or performer to have hands on access and control parameters in their software of choice.<br><br>
  
  [2] A series of books from the 1980's that allowed the reader to litereally choose their own adventure through the book. Would your choice continue the narrative and lead on to further adventure or, much like my experience, lead to a quick and painful death at the hands of a troop of baboons. I cannot have been the only child to read these books to have kept many fingers in pages whilst I figured out my way to survive through the adventure.<br><br>
