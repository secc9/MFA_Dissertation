What even is this?

Worker exploitation is the worker being underpaid and over worked in bad conditions - maybe look into [[id:6F000B76-B4D9-4DCF-B9AB-B6432EA7A9AD][FastFashion]]


Consumer exploitation - exploiting the consumer by overpaying for a commoditiy but that commodity doesnt last due to [[id:9AF5CEE6-5F63-4EDB-A14E-F5D582C812E6][PlannedObsolescence]]


both parties are being exploited for profit by corporations.
