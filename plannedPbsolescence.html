- What is planned obsolescence?
  - my ideas on what it is
    - the manufacturing of products that have a limited lifespan
    - has a faster reason for sale
    - more products are moved


- why does it affect me?
  - it affects me because when I buy something new like a fridge, television or music equipment I get a standard warrenty, be it 1, 2 or maybe even 5 years. But for some reason when that warrenty expires my equiptment suddenly and mysterioulsy breaks. This has been going on now for as long as I can remember. and I'm sure I am not the only person witnessing this phenomemnon. A friend and collegue of mine has, for a few years now, been scouring internet sale sites for audio and music equipment purely by using the spares or repairs filter. After 'winning' the item he then spends time repairing and using it, before selling it on again. I myself have attempted this, only to be let down by my lack of knowledge and skills and so I end up with with more equipment that has been 'broken twice' due to my lack of experience, an empty wallet and an even more crushed self-confidence.



In his pamphlet, published in 1932, "Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence", London complains about how people are using the things they own for much longer that was the norm before the depression. In this case, people are no longer buying anything new due to the great depression the US faced in the early 1930's.
He writes that before the depression, "They replaced old articles with new for reasons of fashion" and "They gave up old homes and old automobiles long before they were worn out, merely because they were obsolete."[1]

The US great depression saw mass unemployment, decline in producion, famine, among many other things. It was proposed by London that the way to get out of this depression was for him to propose the following idea:
- 
- 
I would have the Government assign a lease of life to shoes and homes and machines, to all products of manufacture, mining and agriculture, when they are first created, and they would be sold and used with the term of their existence definitely known by the consumer. After the allotted time had expired, these things would be legally “dead” and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment. New products would constantly be pouring forth from the factories and marketplaces, to take the place of the obsolete, and the wheels of industry would be kept going and employment regularized and assured for the masses. [2]

This is seemingly the first idea of planned obsolescence. The government would somehow put an 'expiry date' on all products. This would assume that factories could continue to make the products as the products already existing in the world would be, at some point in the near future, coming to the end of their life. Consumers would throw out their old products and keep purchasing new ones. The need for production creates employment therefore supplying a disposable income to consumers, who could continue to purchase the products which had become obsolete.

London's idea goes further and stems into the realm of government beurocracy. Consumers should return out of life products to governmnt facilities on where they will be issued some kind of reciept telling of what goods and the state of goods were when returned in, with the possibility of some kind of financial renumeration dependent on the condition of the goods. This would indicate even more employment here, working for the government. But having, once upon a time, been a lowly, local government employee, I can already see the red tape. The endless forms to be filled in by the consumer before even making it out of the house with any items to be returned. The lines of people queueing around the returns building with items ranging anywhere from a pan to a tractor. Being sent away due to filling out a form incorectly. Having  some inexperienced assessor incorrectly evaaluating your car or carriage clock.

London is seeming in belief that government is a well oiled machine. My experience was very much the opposite.
 - The following is not needed, but it feels good to write it down.
Nothing could be done due to layers and layers of employees, all finding a way to keep themselves employed while simutaniously stealing ideas and presenting them as their own.





This feels as though it is reflected now, around a century later. Consumers are happy to continue to purchase new
