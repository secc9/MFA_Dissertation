  <h1>Planned Obsolescence</h1>



  <p>
    Can you remember the last thing you owned that stopped working unexpectedly? Was it your toaster, kettle, fridge, television, computer, the car? In my case, I cannot remember what it could be, but many of my things break often. When purchasing new equipment, you get a standard manufacturer warranty for 1, 2, or even 5 years. But when that warranty expires, the equipment suddenly and mysteriously dies shortly after. This has been happening for as long as I can remember, and I can not be the only person witnessing this phenomenon. A <a href="interlocuters.html">friend and colleague</a> of mine spends his time scouring internet sale sites for audio and music equipment using spares or repair filters. After 'winning' the item, he spends time repairing and using it before selling it again. I have always 
admired his approach. Still, my friend has an electronic engineering background and understands what he is doing. I have attempted this, only to be let down by my lack of knowledge and skills. My enthusiastic results end with more equipment that has been 'broken twice' due to my lack of knowledge and experience, an empty wallet and even more crushed self-confidence.

In his pamphlet, published in 1932, "Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence", London complains about how people are using the things they own for much longer that was the norm before the depression. In this case, people are no longer buying anything new due to the great depression the US faced in the early 1930's.
He writes that before the depression, "They replaced old articles with new for reasons of fashion" and "They gave up old homes and old automobiles long before they were worn out, merely because they were obsolete."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

The US great depression saw mass unemployment, decline in producion, famine, among many other things. To get a real idea of what it could be like I would reccomne It was proposed by London that the way to get out of this depression was for him to propose the following idea:

<blockquote cite="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72003/pg72003-images.html">
  I would have the Government assign a lease of life to shoes and homes and machines, to all products of manufacture, mining and agriculture, when they are first created, and they would be sold and used with the term of their existence definitely known by the consumer. After the allotted time had expired, these things would be legally “dead” and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment. New products would constantly be pouring forth from the factories and marketplaces, to take the place of the obsolete, and the wheels of industry would be kept going and employment regularized and assured for the masses.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>

  </p>



  <p>
This is the first idea of planned obsolescence. The Government should set an 'expiration date' for all products. This would assume that factories could continue to make the products as the products already existing in the world would be, at some point in the near future, coming to the end of their life. Consumers would throw out their old products and keep purchasing new ones. The need for production creates employment, therefore supplying a disposable income to consumers who could continue to buy the products that had become obsolete.
  </p>



  <p>
London's idea goes further and stems into the realm of government bureaucracy. Consumers should return out-of-life products to government facilities, where they will be issued some receipt telling of what goods and the state of goods was when returned, with the possibility of some kind of financial remuneration dependent on the condition of the goods. We could read into this that this act would demand an even higher level of employment. Operating this scheme would require large teams working in Government nationwide. I have, once upon a time, been a lowly local government employee, and I can already see the red tape. The endless forms to be filled in by the consumer before even making it out of the house with any items to be returned. Queues around the returns building with items ranging from a pair of scissors to a tractor. Being sent away due to filling out a form incorrectly and having some inexperienced assessor incorrectly evaluate your car or carriage clock. People fed up with the experience would eventually dump belongings on the street. Maybe a black market appears. This is something that has already been long happening in society. For the last 15 years, we have had a large skip in the car park at the rear of our home. This has long been a common dumping site for people too lazy to go to the local tip. Under the cover of darkness, people are clearing out their homes. Tradesmen empty their vans with full kitchens and bathrooms. Landscape gardeners dumping a garden's worth of vegetation.

   London believes that the Government is, or at least could be, a well-oiled machine. My experience was very much the opposite.
    London's vision, in part, is in process right now, but it is failing. Factories are in constant growth, producing products at rates he could have only imagined. In London's writing, there are plenty of ideas for destroying items but no reasoning for how the items are destroyed and what is to be done with the remains. We have to remember that this is the 1930's. Little thought is given to the afterlife of an item. Return your item to a place, re-purchase a brand-new replacement and forget about it. We are there. We did make it this far. London would be pleased if he were alive to see the results. I cannot help but feel as though London is proposing the idea of a Communist state to prop up a Capitalist ideology. We could already be doing this anyway, as in the 2008 banking crisis the bankers were bailed out by the government payouts and even more recently in the Covid Pandemic.

This feels as though it is reflected now, around a century later. Consumers are happy to continue to purchase new
