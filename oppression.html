  <h1>Oppression of the Working Class</h1>


  <p>
In the UK, although we may no longer realise it (due to the rise of anti-immigration and populist rhetoric), our struggle is the class struggle. "Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other. Bourgeoisie and Proltariat."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Marx wrote this almost 200 years ago, and not much has changed since then.
I did not realise I was the latter until after attending university in my thirties. I had heard the terms in conversation but thought nothing of it. However, I had often felt contempt from people due to (seemingly, to me, innocuous) things like my brutal honesty, employment status and lack (or care) of current affairs.
In my working life, I never chased promotion as I could not understand how moving from hourly paid labour to salaried was a good thing. When younger, I saw students who recently graduated move from hourly to salaried positions, gain more responsibility, and increased hours for what eventually was not a pay increase. Just an increase in perceived power and the change of attitude a title change brought with it. "It is a rare peasant who, once "promoted" to overseer, does not become more of a tyrant towards his former comrades than the owner himself. This is because the context of the peasant's situation, that is, oppression, remains unchanged".<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Throughout my many years of drudgery, I have witnessed this multiple times. Give a person some power and watch them change into a tyrant.

    Throughout my years of drudgery, I have seen this happen many times. Give a person some power and watch them change into a tyrant. 
    The established oppression from hierarchical structures is to force thinking on those below them. Academia is a double-edged sword. While studying for art degrees, my consciousness and awareness have increasingly cracked open. However, simultaneously, I am pushed into a box to train me for the industry as academia is now purely a business. Sometimes, privilege does not realise it is privileged. Classical education is not the only path, but it is fortunate to have had a meritocratic inheritance from parents who are wealthy in resources and/or education, making this path the only acceptable one. I often find myself telling people that I am working through a MFA program as a way to smooth off their first instict of me from the sound of my voice and my rough behavour and language, but also as a way to stick two fingers up at the same people whos behavour changes as soon as I mention a MFA program. The proletariat can become educated, but it is far more difficult. Moreover, this is a problem for the bourgeoisie.

Friere mentions, "The behaviour of the oppressed is a prescribed behaviour, following as it does the guidelines of the oppressor".<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

I witnessed this whilst in the capacity of visiting artist giving workshops at the local music conservatoire, focussing on experimental composition techniques with <a href="openSourceSoftware.html">open-source</a> software. I saw this kind of behaviour during the workshops. I was introducing the SuperCollider package as a way to explore sound-making. Students (oppressed) were already indoctrinated, and, therefore, the institutions (oppressors) teaching methods with tools that the use of anything other than what they had been told to use was completely alien and therefore rejected wholesale. I had also been through this oppression. Going to college to learn production, being taught "industry standard tools", working in the industry, leaving the industry, and having no transferable software skills led to a return to positions I had before my "education". I was stuck mentally, financially, and geographically.

  As Friere says - "The Oppressed, having internalised the image of the oppressor and adopted his guidelines, are fearful of freedom".<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> I continue to feel that the same happens through my master's education. There is much talk of "building your software", but in reality, are given tools considered industry standard. There is no freeing themselves. Universities are now even more under heavy criticism. They are put in a position to equip students for corporate life in capitalism due to a lack of funding. However, there is a definite short-sightedness in this behaviour. A building college I attended to learn carpentry had its curriculum and classes funded by a corporation. The education was only to the limit of being able to build the things the corporation required in the way for them to turn a profit in the long term and not about the longevity, knowledge and skill base of the student. One tutor was famous for being taught by his father and grandfather and forever said aloud, "The old ways are the best ways!"

    At one point my master's program, I began to offer free workshops to my cohort in the SuperCollider language, as lecturers occasionally mentioned it, but not taught by anyone in the university. The workshops were poorly attended. Mainly the same two or three people from previous years. I received good feedback from the participants regarding the actual software. However, I concluded that people do not want to learn a new programming language on top of what they are already doing and are possibly looking for an easy life. A fellow student was suspicious of me and my actions. I responded that I was offering my time and knowledge for free to help people have a different option other than the usual ones. I'm not sure he understood my reasoning.
