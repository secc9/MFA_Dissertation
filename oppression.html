  <h1> The Pedagogy of the Opressed</h1>


  <p>

    I didn't really realise that I was the oppressed until I was in my thirties after I attended university in 2010-2013 for a bachelors in fine arts and music

- "It is a rare peasant who, once "promoted" to overseer, does not become more of a tyrant towards his former comrades than the owner himself. This is because the context of the peasant's situation, that is, oppression, remains unchanged" pg 20

  In my years of labour I have seen this happen many, many times. Give a person some power and watch them change into a tyrant.

  I don't really knw what the point of this quote is. I probabky wont even use it. I just thought it was good and I really related to it. I think that because people are always looking to move out of the position they are in they are willing to be flexible in their personal beliefs.

- "The behaviour of the opressed is a prescribed behaviour, following as it does the guidelines of the opressor" - pg 21

  - for a short while I was a visiting artist giving workshops at the local music school on experimental composition techniques. I saw this kind of behaviour during the workshops. I was attempting to introduce a open source, text based composition tool as a way to explore, but the students (oppressed) had been so indocrinated through the industry and therefore, the institutions (opressors) teaching methods  with tools, that the use of anything other than what they had been told to use was completely alien and therefor rejected wholesale.
   I myself had also been through this oppression. Going to college to learn production, being taught "industry standard tools", working in industry, leaving industry, having no crossover software skills. This led me to going back to jobs that I had been doing before my "education". so in reality I had made no progress forward. I was still stuck, mentally, fanancially, and geographically.

   as Friere says
- "The Oppressed, having internalized the image of the opressr and adopted his guidelines, are fearful of freedom" - pg21

  - I feel that even now, though my masters program that the same thing is happening. There is much talk of "bulding your own software" but in reality the student's are only given tools that are seen to be industy tandard, so in reality there is no freeing themselves.
    Through one term the second year of my masters program, I began to offer free workshops to the other students in my cohort in the SuperCollider language, as it was occasionally mentioned by lecturers, but not taught by anyone in the university. The workshops were very poorly attended. Mainly the same two or three people from previous years. I recieved good feedback from the participants regarding the actual software, but I came to the (uninformed) conclusion that people don't really want to learn a new programming language on top of what they are already doing and are possibly looking for an easy life? I was even questioned by fellow student and my response was that I was offerning my time and knowledge, for free, to help people have a different option other than the usual ones offered. i'm not sure that he understood my reasoning.
