- " the community arts movement, whose emergence in the UK forms part of an international push across Europe and North oAmerica to democrotise and facilitate lay creativity, and to increase accessability to the arts for lessprviliged audiences" [1] - pg 163

  <p>
- " rethinking the artist's place in society in the late 1960s and 1790s: one in which the artist undertakes a placement with a company or a government body, and one in which the individual artist assumes the role of facilitating creativity among 'everyday' people" - pg 163[2]

- [[https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/artist-placement-group][Artist Placement Group]] APG
  - group that went into "Seemingly heavy industry'.
  - sent in artists to work with workers and or management.
  - Artist Stuart Brisley felt that APG were "too enamoured with management."
  - placements "given out" by Barbara Steveni 
  - this could possibly become a critique on the privalage of art school students??
  - Automatically able to work in management. Never even having the notion of working on the shop floor...
  - Further research on wikipedia shows that Latham was the son of colonial administrator Geoffrey Latham. He was educated in England at Winchester College (a fee charging bording school)[3]
  - Barbera Steveni's father worked in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office[4]

- pg 170 - Complaints from reviewers were along the lines of the managerial route. showing praise for management almost. again, this goes back to my complaint about how you can ever know how the prole is living and working if you are fortunate enough not to be born into that class system

  Art is seemingly based on class, and there's not enough work done regarding class conciousness.
  You can only pay lip service, pretend to "slum it for a while: whilst all the time your needs are being met. A holiday from privalige (although who needs a holiday from that). Try living in poverty.

- pg 170 - it was noted by reviewer Peter Fuller that whilst (and I'm paraphrasing here to keep it light) getting the artists into large corporations was impresive but on the other hand placing the artist in a corporation that they wouldnt even be able to be free to make any comment. It wa even written that Latham and Steveni know nothing of Marx and Marxist theories. Possibly this was just a ploy to move up into the uper echelons by the APG founders. Evidence from Bishops writings certainly make it seem this way.


can I just carry on and use this to my own ends without mentioning that Latham didn't really care about the work policies and ethics and was interested in another way? This was was something to do woth him believeing that there is an "absence of an overarching theory of mankind"[7] -pg 177This is the reason for humN conflics, apparently.


It appears that APG was more interested in how an artwork could raise awareness ower a sustained period of time, and thus be valued this way. This was because the "organisasion was committed to the long-term, effects of artisic intervention in society."[8] - pg 170, A true alrtuistic endevour indeed.

- "The community arts movement operated in less glamourous contexts. at a grass-roots level of community activism"[9]-pg177
the grass roots is always less glamourous. Who want's to be working on the ground when you can be cosying up to leaders of industry. The grassroots is important though. Withought this you loose important voices. Since here we are talking about art we end up with art made by middle and upperclass children for middle and upper class people. 

Arts are more taken up by people with an education, therefore if a child sees their parents practicing/playing at something arts based (painting, sculpting, playing a musical instrument), even as a hobby, then it is more likely that the child will also then take up some arts based hobby. Also the same is to be said of the education. A child of a parent with a university degree is more likely to go to university.


  </p>

  <p>
- "those with a degree were around four times more likely to take part in painting and photography than those with no educational qualification, five times more likely to be involved in dance and in crafts, and four times more likely to play a musical instrument."[10]

  I myself never had this experience. No parents or siblings played an instrument. My brother had an interest in art, but due to a family tragedy whilst younger he gave up. (I also believe every child has some artistic leaning, it's just that that is beaten out of you at school in order for you to become factory fodder)- find that quote I have downstaitrs.
