  <h1>Interlocuters</h1>



  <p>
For the longest time (since completing my undergraduate degree), my main interlocutor has been John Tuffen<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. After a chance meeting whilst sharing a bill at one of my early live coding performances, we began slowly getting to know each other whilst bumping into each other at more and more local, small, DIY music performances. After bugging him for a while, I joined his band as a bass player. We proceeded to make music and noise together over the last ten or so years under a number of monikers (neuschalufen, Orlando Ferguson, Electro Battling Droids, Tuffen & Sagar, Polynomial, The Wharf Street Galaxy Band, and most recently, Deluxe Hugs). This chance meeting has led to different things we would never have explored without meeting each other. Playing in these ensembles with him caused me to intensify my study of the electric bass whilst investigating such musical topics as repetition, jazz improvisation, exotic tonalities, DIY software and hardware building and polymetric rhythms. We began a micro netlabel to release music and started a night for local, experimental electronic live music performances. Due to the construction of our audio machines, John has now gone on to make small-format modular synth modules.

I met Simon Hickingbotham<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> while we were both attending the ICLC in 2025. Much like John, we kept spotting each other at local performances, and Simon became involved in helping out at the Wonkystuff nights. Soon, Simon and I formed a duo named Deluxe Hugs (which John later joined).

The three of us meet on a semi-regular basis face to face and online in a group chat to catch up, throw around ideas as well as show and tell about the things we are currently working on and pass around thoughts and ideas on the devices that are made. 
  </p>

  <p>
I feel it has been important to me to have this as a sounding board for thoughts and ideas. I also have friends who share the same lifestyle choices, and it is important for us to meet up to reaffirm the choices we made while being surrounded by the ever-grinding machine of capitalism.

Small DIY collectives, nights, and meetups are a thing of legend, especially within the arts; without them, there would have never been movements such as the impressionists, dadaists, futurists, etc. Meeting up to discuss or react to what has gone before to build what you are making now. It is important to find people who are doing the same, not necessarily with the same background; in fact, different backgrounds are better, as this will make the conversation more malleable and less elitist in favour of the people directing the conversation. It is well known that each new movement was a reaction to the previous movement. But now there are no more movements, so what are we to react against? In the ever-progressing realm of post-capital, technofeudelist almost dictatorships we are finding ourselves in, it becomes more and more difficult to be able to meet. There are less and less places where we can meet. The post-covid phenomenon of randomly increasing prices placed on small venues has begun to financially cripple them. It is well documented that small, grassroots venues have closed or are closing down due to rising energy costsSmall DIY collectives, nights, and meetups are a thing of legend, especially within the arts; without them, there would have never been movements such as the impressionists, dadaists, futurists, etc. Meeting up to discuss or react to what has gone before to build what you are making now.
